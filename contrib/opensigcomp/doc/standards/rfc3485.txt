Abstract

   The Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) is a text-based protocol for
   initiating and managing communication sessions.  The protocol can be
   compressed by using Signaling Compression (SigComp).  Similarly, the
   Session Description Protocol (SDP) is a text-based protocol intended
   for describing multimedia sessions for the purposes of session
   announcement, session invitation, and other forms of multimedia
   session initiation.  This memo defines the SIP/SDP-specific static
   dictionary that SigComp may use in order to achieve higher
   efficiency.  The dictionary is compression algorithm independent.

1. Introduction

   SIP [3] and SDP [24] are text-based protocols that use the UTF-8
   charset (RFC 2279 [5]).  SIP and SDP were designed for rich bandwidth
   links.  However, when SIP/SDP is run over narrow bandwidth links,
   such as radio interfaces or low speed serial links, the session setup
   time increases substantially, compared to an operation over a rich
   bandwidth link.

   The session setup time can decrease dramatically if the SIP/SDP
   signaling is compressed.  The signaling compression mechanisms
   specified in SigComp [1] provide a multiple compression/decompression
   algorithm framework to compress and decompress text-based protocols
   such as SIP and SDP.

   When compression is used in SIP/SDP, the compression achieves its
   maximum rate once a few message exchanges have taken place.  This is
   due to the fact that the first message the compressor sends to the
   decompressor is only partially compressed, as there is not a previous
   stored state to compress against.  As the goal is to reduce the
   session setup time as much as possible, it seems sensible to
   investigate a mechanism to boost the compression rate from the first
   message.

   In this memo we introduce the static dictionary for SIP and SDP.  The
   dictionary is to be used in conjunction with SIP, SDP and SigComp.
   The static SIP/SDP dictionary constitutes a SigComp state that can be
   referenced in the first SIP message that the compressor sends out.

2. Design considerations

   The static SIP/SDP dictionary is a collection of well-known strings
   that appear in most of the SIP and SDP messages.  The dictionary is
   not a comprehensive list of reserved words, but it includes many of
   the strings that appear in SIP and SDP signaling.

   The static dictionary is unique and MUST be available in all SigComp
   implementations for SIP/SDP.  The dictionary is not intended to
   evolve as SIP or SDP evolve.  It is defined once, and stays as is
   forever. This solves the problems of updating, upgrading and finding
   out the dictionary that is supported at the remote end when several
   versions of the same dictionary coexist.

   Appendix A contains the collection of strings that SIP contributed to
   the static dictionary.  The appendix includes references to the
   documents that define those strings.

   Appendix B contains the collection of strings that SDP contributed to
   the static dictionary.  Again, the appendix includes references to
   the documents that define those strings.

   While these appendices are of an informative nature, Section 3 gives
   the normative binary form of the SIP/SDP dictionary.  This is the
   dictionary that is included in the SigComp implementation.  This
   dictionary has been formed from the collection of individual
   dictionaries given in appendices A and B.

   The two input collections are collections of UTF-8 encoded character
   strings.  In order to facilitate the readability, the appendices
   describe them in one table for each collection.  In these tables,
   each row represents an entry.  Each entry contains the string that
   actually occurs in the dictionary, its priority (see below), its
   offset from the first octet and its length (both in hexadecimal), and
   one or more references that elucidate why this string is expected to
   occur in SIP/SDP messages.  Note: Length in this document always
   refers to octets.

   The columns in the tables are described as follows:

   String: represents the UTF-8 string that is inserted into the
   dictionary.  Note that the quotes (") are not part of the string
   itself.  Note also that the notation [CRLF] represents a Carriage
   Return character (ASCII code 0x0D) followed by a Line Feed character
   (ASCII code 0x0A).

RFC 3485       SIP and SDP Static Dictionary for SigComp   February 2003


   Pr: indicates the priority of this string within the dictionary.
   Some compression algorithms, such as DEFLATE, offer an increased
   efficiency when the most commonly used strings are located at the
   bottom of the dictionary.  To facilitate generating a dictionary that
   has the most frequently occurring strings further down at the bottom,
   we have decided to allocate a priority to each string in the
   dictionary.  Priorities range from 1 until 5.  A low number in the
   priority column (e.g., 1) indicates that we believe in a high
   probability of finding the string in SIP or SDP messages.  A high
   number in the priority column (e.g., 5) indicates lower probability
   of finding the string in a SIP or SDP message.  This is typically the
   case for less frequent error codes or optional infrequent tags.

   Off: indicates the hexadecimal offset of the entry with respect to
   the first octet in the dictionary.  Note that several strings in the
   collections can share space in the dictionary if they exhibit
   suitable common substrings.

   Len: the length of the string (in octets, in hexadecimal).

   References: contains one or more references to the specification and
   the section within the specification where the string is defined.

   Note that the strings stored in the dictionary are case sensitive.
   (Again, the strings do not comprise the quotes ("), they are just
   shown here to increase the readability.)  Where the string is a
   header field, we also included the colon ":" and the amount of white
   space expected to occur.  Note that this means that not all messages
   that conform to the SIP Augmented BNF, which allows other
   combinations (e.g., a white space or horizontal tabulator before the
   colon (":")  sign), will benefit as much from the dictionary -- the
   best increase in compression performance is to be expected for
   messages that use the recommended formatting guidelines for SIP.

   Some strings appear followed by an equal sign and some others do not.
   This depends on whether the string is part of a parameter name or a
   parameter value.

   In a SIP message, all the SIP headers terminate with a CRLF pair of
   characters.  As these characters are appended to the end of each SIP
   header line, right after the header values, and because the header
   values are typically not part of the static SIP dictionary, we cannot
   include the terminating CRLF as part of the SIP static dictionary.
   Instead, the approach we have taken is to include in each header
   field entry the CRLF from the previous line that prefixes every
   header field.  We have represented CRLF by the notation [CRLF].
   Therefore, in generating the actual binary dictionary, an entry in
   the dictionary represented as: "[CRLF]From: " has been interpreted as

RFC 3485       SIP and SDP Static Dictionary for SigComp   February 2003


   an entry whose value is CR, LF, the word From, a colon and a
   whitespace.

   Note that most SIP header field names are included with the full
   string from CRLF to the colon-blank pair.  However, in certain
   situations, when the likelihood of occurrence is not considered high
   (as indicated by a priority value of 3 to 5), and when there are
   common substrings shared by a number of headers, we have added one
   entry with the common substring and several entries with the non-
   common substrings remaining.  An example is the "Proxy-Authenticate"
   and "Proxy-Authorization" headers.  There are three entries in the
   dictionary: the common substring "[CRLF]Proxy-", and the non-common
   substrings "Authenticate: " and "Authorization: ".  This allows the
   re-use of the non-common substrings by other entries and may save a
   number of bytes in the binary form of the dictionary.  Note that this
   splitting mechanism does not apply with strings that are likely to
   occur very often (those whose priority is set to 1 or 2).

   SIP responses start with a status code (e.g., "302") and a reason
   phrase (e.g., "Moved Temporarily").  The status code is a normative
   part, whereas the reason phrase is not normative, it is just a
   suggested text.  For instance, both "302 Moved Temporarily" and "302
   Redirect" are valid beginnings of SIP responses.

   In the SIP dictionary we have included two entries per response code,
   one including only the status code and a space (e.g., "302 ") and
   another one including both the status code and the suggested reason
   phrase (e.g., "302 Moved Temporarily").  The former can be used when
   the SIP response changed the suggested reason phrase to another one.
   The latter can be used when the suggested reason phrase is part of
   the response.  In this way, we accommodate both alternatives.  (Note
   that in the actual dictionary, both strings occupy the same space in
   the string subset, but have two separate entries in the table
   subset.)

3. Binary representation of the SIP/SDP dictionary

   This section contains the result of combining the SIP and the SDP
   dictionaries described in appendices A and B in order to create a
   single dictionary that is loaded into SigComp as a state.

   The binary SigComp dictionary is comprised of two parts, the
   concatenation of which serves as the state value of the state item: A
   string subset, which contains all strings in the contributing
   collections as a substring (roughly ordered such that strings with
   low priority numbers occur at the end), and a table subset, which
   contains pairs of length and offset values for all the strings in the
   contributing collections.  In each of these pairs, the length is



Garcia-Martin, et al.       Standards Track                     [Page 5]

RFC 3485       SIP and SDP Static Dictionary for SigComp   February 2003


   stored as a one-byte value, and the offset is stored as a two-byte
   value that has had 1024 added to the offset (this allows direct
   referencing from the stored value if the dictionary state has been
   loaded at address 1024).

   The intention is that all compression algorithms will be able to use
   the (or part of the) string subset, and some compression methods,
   notably those that are related to the LZ78 family, will also use the
   table in order to form an initial set of tokens for that compression
   method.  The text below therefore gives examples for referencing both
   the table subset and the string subset of the dictionary state item.

   As defined in section 3.3.3 in the Signaling Compression
   specification [1], a SigComp state is characterized by a certain set
   of information.  For the static SIP/SDP dictionary, the information
   in the following Table 1 fully characterizes the state item.

   Note that the string subset of the dictionary can be accessed using:

      STATE-ACCESS (%ps, 6, 0, 0x0D8C, %sa, 0),

   and the table subset can be accessed using:

      STATE-ACCESS (%ps, 6, 0x0D8C, 0x0558, %sa, 0),

   where %ps points to UDVM memory containing

      0xfbe507dfe5e6

   and %sa is the desired destination address in UDVM memory (with UDVM
   byte copying rules applied).

   If only a subset of the dictionary up to a specific priority is
   desired (e.g., to save UDVM space), the values for the third and
   forth operand in these STATE-ACCESS instructions can be changed to:

   Priorities  String  String  Table   Table
   desired     offset  length  offset  length
   ==========  ======  ======  ======  ======
   1 only      0x0CB2  0x00DA  0x0D8C  0x003F
   1..2        0x0920  0x046C  0x0D8C  0x0147

Appendix A. SIP input strings to the SIP/SDP static dictionary

   For reference, this section lists the SIP input strings that were
   used in generating the dictionary, as well as a priority value, the
   offset of the string in the generated dictionary, the length of the
   string, and one or more references into the referenced documents that
   motivate the presence of this string.  Note that the notation
   "[CRLF]" stands for a sequence of two bytes with the values 0x0d and
   0x0a, respectively.

   The priority value is used for determining the position of the string
   in the dictionary.  Lower priority values (higher priorities) cause
   the string to occur at a later position in the dictionary, making it
   more efficient to reference the string in certain compression
   algorithms.  Hence, lower priority values were assigned to strings
   more likely to occur.

Appendix B. SDP input strings to the SIP/SDP static dictionary

   For reference, this section lists the SDP input strings that were
   used in generating the dictionary, as well as a priority value, the
   offset of the string in the generated dictionary, the length of the
   string, and one or more references into the referenced documents that
   motivate the presence of this string.  Note that the notation
   "[CRLF]" stands for a sequence of two bytes with the values 0x0d and
   0x0a, respectively.

   The priority value is used for determining the position of the string
   in the dictionary.  Lower priority values (higher priorities) cause
   the string to occur at a later position in the dictionary, making it
   more efficient to reference the string in certain compression
   algorithms.  Hence, lower priority values were assigned to strings
   more likely to occur.
