/**
   This class holds constructor-time initialization arguments for SipStack.

   Most values are pointers, and default to zero unless otherwise indicated.

   It has public members:
      mSecurity
         Security Object required by the stack for TLS, DTLS, SMIME and
         Identity-draft compliance.  If empty the stack will not support
         these advanced security features.  The compile flag USE_SSL is
         also required.  The security object will be owned by the SipStack
         and deleted in the SipStack destructor.

       mAsyncProcessHandler
          AsyncProcessHandler that will be invoked when Messages
          are posted to the stack.  Posted messages are added
          to thread-safe queue, and then processed later within
          event loop. For example:  SelectInterruptor.

       mStateless
          This parameter does not appear to be used. Default false.

       mSocketFunc
          A pointer to a function that will be called after a socket in
          the DNS or SIP transport layers of the stack has been created.
          This callback can be used to control low level socket options,
          such as Quality-of-Service/DSCP.  Note:  For SIP TCP sockets
          there is one call for the listen socket, and one (or two)
          calls for each connection created afterwards.  For each inbound
          TCP connection the first callback is called immediately before
          the socket is connected, and if configured it is called again
          after the connect call has completed and before the first data
          is sent out.  On some OS's you cannot set QOS until the socket
          is successfully connected.  To enable this behavior call:
                  Connection::setEnablePostConnectSocketFuncCall();

       mCompression
          Compression configuration object required for
          SigComp. If set to 0, then SigComp compression
          will be disabled. The SipStack takes ownership of this object,
          and will be deleted in the destructor.

       mPollGrp
          Polling group to support file-io callbacks.
          See EventStackThread. The SipStack does NOT take ownership;
          the application (or a helper such as EventStackSimpleMgr) must
          release this object after the SipStack is destructed.

        mUseDnsVip
           Set to true to enable Whitelisting of DNS entries.  A feature
           that usually desired by UA's that want to stick to a known
           good server / dns result.

/**
   @brief This is the primary point of interaction between the app-layer and the
      stack.

   @details For a SipStack to be usable, transports must be added by calling
   the addTransport() method.

   The useful work done by SipStack occurs when
   SipStack::process(unsigned int) is called.  A separate thread (such 
   as EventStackThread) can be dedicated to this task, or it can be called
   from within a loop in the main thread of the executable.

   Graceful shutdown is accomplished by advising the SipStack to begin
   shutdown procedures via the shutdown() method.  The SipStack should
   continue to be serviced through the process(unsigned int) method until the
   Transaction User is informed by receiving a ShutdownMessage that
   the requested shutdown is complete.

   @note Previously, buildFdSet(FdSet&), FdSet::select(), and process(FdSet&) 
      were the canonical way of giving the SipStack cycles. Because of 
      shortcomings of the fd_set approach, these have been deprecated.

            in single-threaded mode.

         This call will allow all the components in the SipStack a chance to 
         perform processing. This includes:

         - Transaction processing (handling of SIP messages and timers)
         - DNS processing (includes DNS network IO and 3263 logic)
         - Transport processing (network IO for raw SIP traffic)
         - Application timers

         To give the SipStack cycles, it is sufficient to simply call this 
         function repeatedly.

         @param timeoutMs The maximum time, in milliseconds, we will wait for IO 
            in this call. We will not necessarily wait this long if no IO 
            occurs; if timers are scheduled to fire before this duration 
            elapses, our timeout value will be adjusted accordingly. Similarly, 
            if there is work waiting in fifos when this call is made, no timeout 
            will be used. Lower values will cause higher CPU utilization when 
            idle, higher values may result in processing delays of messages from 
            the TU sent during the call to process(unsigned int) (eg; you call 
            process(50), then immediately schedule an app timer to fire in 25ms, 
            or send a SipMessage to the stack, it could be 50ms before either of 
            these are processed). You can work around these caveats by creating 
            a SelectInterruptor, adding its FD to the SipStack's FdPollGrp, and 
            calling SelectInterruptor::interrupt() to cause 
            process(unsigned int) to be interrupted. The best approach will 
            vary, based on your performance needs.

         @note If you wish to add an FD that will interrupt this call if it 
            becomes ready (either because it has IO you are interested in, or 
            merely to interrupt this call to carry out some unrelated task, see

         will take the Content-Length seriously, log a warning if the 
         Content-Length is too short, and reject the message if the 
         Content-Length is too long.
         @param check Denotes whether we should check Content-Length.

         Sets the CongestionManager used by the stack.
         In order to use a congestion-manager, you will need to create one and 
         pass it to the SipStack, like so:

         @code
          MyCongestionManager* mCM = new MyCongestionManager;
          mStack.setCongestionManager(mCM);
         @endcode

         This will cause the SipStack to register all its fifos with the 
         congestion manager, and will also call 
         TransactionUser::setCongestionManager() for every currently registered 
         TransactionUser. This means that, if you are working with 
         such a TransactionUser, you must have registered the TransactionUser 
         with the SipStack before making this call.
         
         If you are using the SipStack directly by implementing your own 
         subclass of TransactionUser, you can override 
         TransactionUser::setCongestionManager() to register additional fifos 
         (the default implementation registers TransactionUser::mFifo), like so
         
         @code
         MyTransactionUser::setCongestionManager(CongestionManager* cm)
         {
          TransactionUser::setCongestionManager(cm);
