reSIProcate release process
===========================

This document explains the process for building a release of the
reSIProcate software.

Deliverables
------------

The only official deliverable is the tarball, for example,
resiprocate-1.8.0.tar.gz

As a courtesy to users, a contrib tarball is also produced,
containing some third party code, some of it patched for
use with a specific version of reSIProcate:
resiprocate-contrib-1.8.0.tar.gz

Building of binary packages (e.g. for Debian, RPM, OpenCSW) is
done after the tarball release.  That is not covered here.

Workspace
---------

Obtain a release branch from SVN, using the git-svn tool.
git-svn is used because it makes it easier to build a clean tarball
(without the risk of distributing .svn/* by mistake)

  git svn clone \
    --trunk=https://svn.resiprocate.org/rep/resiprocate/main/branches/release-1.8 \
    resip-1.8

  cd resip-1.8

Version/tag
-----------

Update version information and tag it:

  vi configure.ac         (update the version and ABIVERSION numbers)
  git add configure.ac && git commit -m 'Update to version 1.8.5'
  git svn dcommit         (send changes back to SVN)

  svn copy https://svn.resiprocate.org/rep/resiprocate/main/branches/release-1.8 https://svn.resiprocate.org/rep/resiprocate/main/tags/1.8.5

Bootstrap
---------

The bootstrap must always be done on the same version of autotools
for consistency.  The currently endorsed version is the autotools
distributed in Debian 6.0 (squeeze).  If another version is to be used,
it should be discussed on the mailing list and noted in this document.

  autoreconf --install

Make a tarball
--------------

  ./configure --with-ssl && make dist

Sanity check on tarball
-----------------------

  Extract the tarball to /tmp/some-folder/resiprocate-1.8.5

  cd /tmp/some-folder/resiprocate-1.8.5
  ./configure && make -j 12 check

Distribute the tarball
----------------------

  sha256sum resiprocate-1.8.5.tar.gz

  Upload the tarball to the pre-release section of the web site

  Send a PGP signed email to the developers list announcing that
  a release candidate has been built.  Other developers may test the tarball.

  Include the SHA-256 checksum in the PGP signed email.

Confirm the release
-------------------

  Upload the tarball to the official download page

  Send a PGP signed email to the resip-announce and users lists
  announcing that the release candidate is now an official release.

  Include the SHA-256 checksum in the PGP signed email.
