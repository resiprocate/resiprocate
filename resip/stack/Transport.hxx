/**
 * TransportFlags is bit-mask that can be set when creating a transport.
 * All flags default to "off" to preserve "traditional" resip behavior.
 * Not all Transports support all flags. All options are experimental.
 * The flags are:
 * NOBIND:
 *    On transports that support it (TCP/TLS), do not bind a listening
 *    socket; thus no in-bound connections are possible. This can conserve
 *    ports and avoid port conflicts in pure-outbound (NAT'd) cases.
 * RXALL:
 *    When receiving from socket, read all possible messages before
 *    returning to event loop. This allows higher thruput. Without this flag,
 *    only one message is read at a time, which is slower over-all, but
 *    is more "even" and balanced.
 * TXALL:
 *    When transmitting to a socket, write all possible messages before
 *    returning to event loop. This allows higher thruput but burstier.
 * TXNOW:
 *    When a message to transmit is posted to Transport's transmit queue
 *    immediately try sending it. This should have less latency
 *    and less overhead with select/poll stuff, but will have deeper
 *    call stacks.
 * OWNTHREAD:
 *    Specifies whether this Transport object has its own thread (ie; if
 *    set, the TransportSelector should not run the select/poll loop for
 *    this transport, since that is another thread's job)

   @brief The base class for Transport classes.

   A Transport presents layer 4 of the OSI model, the transport layer.
   For IP-based protocols, this means that a Transport object has an
   IP address (v4 or v6), a transport layer protocol (UDP or TCP/TLS),
   and a port number.  These are managed through the Transport's Tuple
   member.
