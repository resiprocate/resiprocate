// This class is used to create Processors that need to accomplish blocking
// tasks, such as database access.  The request/event is delivered to this 
// Processor, like any other via the virtual method:
// virtual processor_action_t process(RequestContext &)
//
// When a blocking task is required, it can be queued up for the thread pool 
// of workers, that are implemented in the constructor provided asyncDispatcher, by
// constructing a new AsyncProcessorMessage and calling mAsyncDispatcher->post
// AsyncProcessorMessage implementations should contain any data needed by the 
// threads and contain any members required to hold the blocking functions
// return data or results.
//
// When a worker thread picks up the message it will call the virtual method:
// virtual void asyncProcess(AsyncProcessorMessage* msg)
// The implementation of this method should perform the actual blocking function
// calls - ie. database access call.  If there is any data to return it should be
// set in the provided AsyncProcessorMessage before returning from asyncProcess.
//
// The dispatcher will then queue this message up to be sent back to the 
// AsyncProcessor, via the virtual method:
// virtual processor_action_t process(RequestContext &)
// This virtual method will need to examine the event type to see if the event is
// a new request or an asynchronous result message (AsyncProcessorMessage).
