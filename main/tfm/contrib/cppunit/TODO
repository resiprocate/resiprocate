* CppUnit:
  - Unicode support
  - STL orthodox template for container elements.
  - CompilerOutputter support for gcc error format:
	g++ -DHAVE_CONFIG_H -I. -I. -I../../config -I../../include -I../../include -g -O2 -c TextOutputter.cpp -Wp,-MD,.deps/TextOutputter.TPlo  -fPIC -DPIC
	TextOutputter.cpp:5: cppunit/TextOutputter.h: No such file or directory

* VC++ TestRunner:
  - Make it possible to specify the registry path where settings are stored.
    Current method use the path defined in the CWinApp. This does not work
    for console application
  - Add "details" field to show detail of the selected failed test:
    - suite and test name,
    - failure message. If possible separate "was" and "expected" in the
      forthcoming assertEquals() to make comparison easier,
    - source file location. 
    
* BugFix: CompilerOutputter::wrap(), bug when wrapping empty line in the middle 
of a text (they disappear).    

* Documentation:
	CookBook:
	- how to create simple test cases (with CppUnit namespace)
	  - test case using only CPPUINT_ASSERT
	  - test case using CPPUNIT_ASSERT_EQUAL
	  - advanced assertions with the CPPUNIT_ASSERT_MESSAGE
	- Helper Macros for convenience
	- Creating a suite
	- Composing a suite from more suits (i.e. compose tests for n modules to
	  form a big test for the whole program)
	- customizing output using an user defined TestListener
	  - how to write the TestListener (subclass of TestListener)
	  - how to hook it in
	- how to use the GUI
	  - MSVC++ special stuff
	- other custmization stuff I haven't understood yet
