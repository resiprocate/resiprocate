Change the names of all the parser "components" to "integerparser" or
something like that

Complete the pre parser stuff so that transport can do framented messages

Change name of HeadersTy


need to add quote interface to DataParameter -- particularly, fetching
a parameter should return DataParameter& rather than Data .  the
application is responsible for passing in a quoted string if they want
quotes.

the application will never get back a quoted one when it asks for a
DataParameter.

there should be a UserData which is used for anything the user might
input.  it has the property that the stack will examine the contents
for quotable material, e.g. if you pass in

	Bob Smith

it will produce either

	Bob%20Smith

or

	"Bob Smith"

depending on what's right.


Missing classes of headers:

	Date
	Warning
	(someone should check these after done)

Make Symbols Data

Convert Data to unsigned char interface.

Add correct const semantics to parserCategories
explicity disallow paramaters or declare parameter accessors where they can be used
If we proper const parameter retrieval we should probably throw if the user tries to retrieve a parameter that doesn't exist.
