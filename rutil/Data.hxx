/**
  @brief An alternative to std::string, encapsulates an arbitrary buffer of 
  bytes.

  It has a variety of memory management styles that can be
  established at contruction time and changed later via setBuf().

  Three modes of allocation are currently available:

    @li 'Borrow' - The Data instance is borrowing the memory from the passed
                   in buffer. It will modify its contents as necessary,
                   but will not deallocate it.
            
    @li 'Share'  - The Data instance will use the buffer in a read-only mode.
                   If any attempt is made to modify the contents of
                   the Data, it will copy the buffer and modify it.
           
    @li 'Take'   - The Data instance takes complete ownership of the
                   buffer. The buffer is deallocated using delete[].

   Additionally, Data has a small locally-allocated buffer (member buffer) that
   it will use to hold small amounts of data. By default, this buffer can 
   contain 16 bytes, meaning that Data will not use the heap unless it
   needs more than 16 bytes of space. The tradeoff here, of course, is that
   instances of Data will be larger than instances of std::string. Generally
   speaking, if you expect to need more than 16 bytes of room, and you cannot
   make good use of the flexible memory management offered by Data, you may want
   to use a std::string instead.

  @see RESIP_HeapCount

  @todo It might be worthwhile examining the heap usage of this
        class in the context of using realloc everywhere appropriate.
        (realloc is defined in ANSI C, SVID, and the OpenGroup "Single
        Unix Specification").

        @note Assuming scheme contents allows the use of a bitmask instead of
         tolower(), which is faster. Why, you ask? A bitmask is sufficient to 
         perform a lowercase operation on alphabetical data, since 'a' and 'A' 
         only differ on bit 6; it is set for 'a', but not for 'A'. Digits always 
         have bit 6 set, so setting it is a no-op. The last three characters in 
         the scheme character set are '+', '-', and '.'; all of these have bit 6 
         set as well. Note that there is no corresponding efficient uppercase 
         function; clearing bit 6 on either a digit or the the three remaining 
         characters (+=.) will change them.
