/**
  @brief This class abstracts the Unix system call "poll".

  It offers implementations in terms of "poll" itself, "epoll", and "select".
  (Respectively #ifdef'd by RESIP_POLL_IMPL_POLL, RESIP_POLL_IMPL_SELECT, and
  RESIP_POLL_IMPL_EPOLL.)
  File descriptors are wrapped by inner class "Poll::FDEntry".
  The actual "poll" call is represented by method "wait", or if an application
  wants to control the system call directly, it can instead use methods
  "beforeExternWait", "setEntryFDStateForExternWait", and "afterExternWait".
  (The latter are selected by #define-ing RESIP_POLL_EXTERN.)
