/**
 * This file needs to work for both C and C++ code.
 *
 * The resip_assert() macro is preferred over regular assert()
 * for all library and application code.  Unit tests should continue
 * to use regular assert().  Third party code placed on contrib
 * should not be adapted to use resip_assert()
 *
 * It is possible to redefine resip_assert() to provide additional logging
 * or throw an exception such as std::runtime_error() as desired.
 *
 * On UNIX systems, this could add a call to syslog.  On Windows,
 * it could be a notification in the system's event log.
 *
 * CAUTION: do not call other reSIProcate stack methods from here.
 * For example, do not try to use the reSIProcate logger or even
 * basic classes like resip::Data.  If the resip_assert() was
 * invoked from one of those other low-level classes then the stack
 * may be in such a bad state that they behave unpredictably
 * or even worse, recursion may occur if resip_assert() is invoked
 * again.  We may do further work on this code to make it work
 * safely with the logger but at present it is not ready for that.
