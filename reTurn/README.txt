What is reTurn?
---------------
reTurn is a Stun/Turn server and client library implementation of the latest 
Stun/Turn drafts:  RFC5389, and draft-ietf-behave-turn-15


Current External Library Usage
------------------------------
- currently uses OpenSSL, ASIO, BOOST and RUTIL
- OpenSSL
       - Used for TLS support (optional)
       - libcrypto used for calculating message authentication code (mandatory
         part of TURN, even without TLS)
       - Therefore,  unlike other parts of resiprocate, it is mandatory
         to have OpenSSL present for building reTurn, and you must
         specify --with-ssl when running configure or reTurn/* won't
         be built at all.
- ASIO - 1.2.0
       - Used for server sockets and transports
       - Tuple information used in StunMessage uses asio::ip::udp::endpoint - easily changed
       - StunMessage, TurnAllocation and RequestHandler use asio::ip:address to manipulate IPV6, 
         and IPV4 StunAddresses - easily changed
       - StunTuple uses asio::ip::address - easily changed
- BOOST - 1.34.1
        - Using BOOST in no-lib mode is fine
        - BOOST::bind is used in server transports
        - BOOST::crc_optimal is used for fingerprint CRC calculations
- RUTIL - Data class is used in StunMessage and StunAuth for strings and TurnData

Don't Fragment Attribute               no           no      Server will reject requests asking for DF option


General TODO
-------------
- reduce library use - remove BOOST and/or rutil requirement - remove ASIO for client??
- allow multiple interfaces to be used for relay
- per user allocation quota enforcement
- cleanup stun message class so that there are accessors for all data members
- from chart above
 - Configuration Framework
 - Multi-threaded support in Server
 - Bandwidth check
 - TCP Relay
- Short Term passwords do not make any sense in reTurnServer (outside of RFC3489 backcompat) - they need to be supported on client APIs

TURN TODO's
-----------
- CreatePermission requests can contain multiple addresses - need to modify StunMessage in order to support this
- Clients need to install permissions before data can be sent - need to queue outbound data until CreateChannel response is received
- ChannelData messages must be padded to a multiple of 4 bytes, the padding is not to be reflected in the encoded length
- When client receives a Data Ind - it should ensure it is from an endpoint that it believes that it has installed a permission for, otherwise drop
- It is recommended that the client check if a permission exists towards the peer that just send a ChannelData message, if not - discard
- Could add checking that ChannelData messages always begin with bits 0b01, since bits 0b10 and 0b11 are reserved
- Need to give clients the ability to add Don't Fragment header to Allocate request
- If request with Don't Fragment fails with 420 code, then it can be retried without Don't Fragment (this will likely remain the responsibilty of the reTurn client application)
- It is recommended that the server impose limits on both the number of allocations active at one time for a given username and on the amount of bandwidth those allocations use. - 486 (Allocation Quota Exceeded)
- Port allocation algorithm should be better to ensure we won't run into collisions with other applications - port allocations should be random
- If the client receives a 400 response to a channel-bind request, then it is recommended that the allocation be deleted, and the client start again with a new allocation

RFC53389 TODO's
---------------
-Username must contain UTF-8 sequence of bytes, and must have been processed by SASLprep
-Realm qdtext or quoted-pair - It must UTF-8 encoded and MUST be less than 128 characters (which can be as long as 763 bytes), and must be processed by SASLprep
-Nonce qdtext or quoted-pair - MUST be less than 128 characters (which can be as long as 763 bytes)
-Software must be a UTF-8 sequence of less than 128 characters (which can be as long as 763 byes)
-The Password used in the HMAC key must be SASLprep processed
-remove quotes and trailing nulls from username, realm.  remove trailing nulls from password before forming MD5 hash for message integrity
-Errorcode Reason Phrase must be a UTF-8 sequence of less than 128 characters (which can be as long as 763 byes)
-need handling for 300 Try Alternate response - currently applications responsibility
-the following values should be configurable
 - Initial RTO (default 500ms)
 - Rc (default 7)
 - Rm (default 16)
-actual RTO should be calculated
-UDP retransmissions should stop if a hard ICMP error is seen
-DNS SRV Discovery - currently only does host record lookup (using ASIO) - _stun._udp, _stun._tcp, _stuns._tcp, _turn._udp, _turn._tcp, _turns._tcp

Client TODO
-----------
- rework synchronous sockets to use Asynchrous sockets to unify implementation better
- keepalive usage??
- add option to require message integrity? - depends on usage - ICE
- add ability to install a permission or binding without sending data

Client Notes
------------         
- retries should be paced at 500ms, 1000ms, 2000ms, etc. - after 442, 443, or 444 response - currently applications responsibility
- If a client receives a 437 allocation mismatch response to an allocate, then it should retry using a different client transport address - it should do this 3 times (this will likely remain the responsibilty of the reTurn client application)
- To prevent race conditions a client MUST wait 5 mins after the channel binding expires before attempting to bind the channel number to a different transport address or the transport address to a different channel number (within the same allocation?).


Client API
-----------
Current Asynchronous Implementation:
- Application must provide an asio::io_service object and is responsible for threading it out and calling run
- Async Turn sockets must be held in a shared pointer, in order to ensure safety of asio callbacks - this could be abstracted better
- When Async sockets are created a callback handler class is passed in to receive callback notifications when 
  operations are complete

API Set - Wrapping in a Turn(Async)Socket - Turn(Async)UdpSocket, Turn(Async)TcpSocket, Turn(Async)TlsSocket 
        - bound to local socket
 * setUsernameAndPassword()
 * requestSharedSecret() - username and password are returned
 * createAllocation(lifetime, 
                    bandwidth, 
                    requestedPortProps, 
                    reservationToken, 
                    requestedTransportType)
 * refreshAllocation(lifetime)
 * destroyAllocation() 
 * getRelayTuple() - (SYNC API ONLY) used to retrieve info about the allocation
 * getReflexiveTuple() - (SYNC API ONLY) used to retrieve info about the allocation
 * getLifetime() - (SYNC API ONLY) used to retrieve info about the allocation
 * getBandwidth() - (SYNC API ONLY) used to retrieve info about the allocation
 * setActiveDestination(destinationIP, destinationPort)
 * clearActiveDestination()
 * bindRequest() 
 * send(bufferToSend, bufferSize);      
 * sendTo(destinationIP, destinationPort, bufferToSend, bufferSize)
 * receive(bufferToReceiveIn, bufferSize[in/out], senderIPAddress, senderPort) 
   - last 2 args are return args - if receive is non-blocking then this data is returned in callback instead 
 * receiveFrom(bufferToReceiveIn, bufferSize[in/out], senderIPAddress, senderPort) 
   - in this case last 2 args are input and specify endpoint we want to receive from

NOTE:  could also add a binding discovery API for attempting to detect NAT type using RFC3489 methods
