/**
  This class is used to manage membership of participants.

  Conversations are used to designate the audio properties
  between a number of managed participants.  By default all
  participants in a Conversation can talk to and hear all 
  other participants.  A modified participants contribution 
  setting to a conversation can change this.

  If a remote participant is a sole member in a conversation, 
  then he/she will be put on hold.
