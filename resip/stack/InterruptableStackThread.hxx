/** 
    This class is used to create a thread to run the SipStack in.  The
    thread provides cycles to the SipStack by calling process.  Process
    is called when select returns a signaled file descriptor.

    This implementation improves on StackThread, by providing a fully
    blocking architecture (ie. no need to wake up every 25ms), since 
    posting to TransactionState will cause the SelectInterruptor to
    be invoked.

    You must register SelectInterrupter as an AsyncProcessHandler on the 
    SipStack in order to use this class.  This is done by providing 
    SelectInterrupter to the constructor of SipStack.  This should be 
    the same SelectInterrupter provided when constructing this class.
