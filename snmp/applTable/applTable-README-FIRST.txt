applTable README
------------------------------------------------------------------------
This document describes the results of the mib2c code generation
system using the mfd code generation template.  The resulting files
are documented both in this README file as well as per-table specific
README files.  All of the files generated by this run of mib2c will
begin with the applTable prefix.

Quick Start
-----------
For those interested in a quick start, to get a pseudo-todo list, try
this command in directory with the generated code:

 grep -n "TODO:" *.[ch] | sed 's/\([^ ]*\) \(.*\)TODO\(.*\)/\3 (\1)/' | sort -n

Key:
  :o: Optional
  :r: Recommended
  :M: Mandatory
  :A: Advanced users

This will give you and ordered list of places in the code that you
may (or must) take a closer look at).

MIBs For Dummies Overview
-------------------------
The MIBs For Dummies (MFD) configuration files have been written to help
SNMP novices implement SNMP MIBs. This section will be a brief
introduction to some of the general concepts you should be familar with.

  Managed Information Base (MIB)
  ------------------------------
  A SNMP MIB (Managed information base) is a text file that describes the
  syntax for some set of data objects. The MIB creates a correlation
  between an ASCII name for an object and a number OID (Object Identifier).
  The SNMP protocol communicates information using the OIDs, and the MIB
  allows tools to display a name, which we humans find easier to deal with.

  To use an analogy, a MIB is much like a menu at a restaurant. If you've
  ever been to a reataurant and ordered a meal, and later received a bill
  that simply had '#6' on it, you get the idea. The name is easier for
  the customers to remember, and the waiters and chefs use the number for
  efficency.


    Scalars
    -------
    A scalar variable is a unique object in a MIB which can represent
    a single value. For example, the SNMP standard MIB-II defines a
    variable, sysContact.0, which is a string containing the contact
    information for the person in charge of a particular agent. Note
    that scalar variable always end with '.0'.
    

    Rows and Tables
    ---------------
    When a group of related attributes occur more than once, they can be
    grouped together in a table. A table has an index, which uniquely
    identifies a particular row, and data columns, which contain the
    attributes for that row.

    For example, the SNMP standard MIB-II defines a table, ifTable, which
    contains information on the ethernet interfaces on a system.
    

  Data Structures
  ---------------
  The code generated by the MFD configuration files has a few important
  structures.


    The Data Context
    ----------------
    The data context structure should contain the necessary information
    to provide the data for the columns in a given row. As long as you
    can extract the data for a column for the data context, the data context
    can be anything you want: a pointer to an existing structure, the
    parameters needed for a function call or an actual copy of the data.

    By default, a data context structure is generated with storage for
    all the data in a row. Information on changing the default is presented
    later on in this help.


    The MIB Context
    ---------------
    The MIB context structure is generated with storage for all the
    indexes of a table. This data will be used when searching for the
    correct row to process for a request.


    The Row Request Context
    -----------------------
    Each table will have a unique data structure for holding data during
    the processing of a particular row. The row request context contains
    the registration context (that you supply during initilization),
    the data context, the MIB context, the undo context (for settable
    tables) and other data. There is also a netsnmp_data_list, which can
    be used to temporary storage during processing.


    The Table Registration Pointer
    ------------------------------
    During initilization, you may provide a pointer to arbitrary data for
    you own use. This pointer will be saved in the row request context,
    and is passed as a parameter to several functions. It is not required,
    and is provided as a way for you to access table specific data in
    the generated code.



These files are top-level files potentially useful for all the tables: 
------------------------------------------------------------------------

  File    : applTable_Makefile
  ----------------------------------------------------------------------
  Purpose : Make file for compiling a (sub)agent.  This file is only
            useful if you don't want to compile your code directly
            into the Net-SNMP master agent.
  Editable: Optional
  Usage   : make -f applTable_Makefile


  File    : applTable_subagent.c
  ----------------------------------------------------------------------
  Purpose : This file contains a main() function for an agent or
            sub-agent and is compiled using the Makefile above.




Table specific README files
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Each table for which code was generated has its own README file
describing the files specifically associated with each table.  You
should probably read these next:

   applTable-README-applTable.txt



These are miscellaneous auto-generated code files you generally
shouldn't edit.  They contain code that ties your code together with
the Net-SNMP agent.
------------------------------------------------------------------------
  File    : applTable.h
  Purpose : Header file for the module set.  Includes config_require
            macros to auto-load the other code pieces when compiled
            into the agent.

  File    : applTable_oids.h
  Purpose : C #define definitions of the tables, columns, and OIDs

  File    : applTable_enums.h
  Purpose : C #define definitions of the enumerated type values for
            each column of each table that requires them.

  File    : applTable_interface.c
  Purpose : MFD interface to Net-SNMP.  This auto-generated code ties the
            functions you will fill out to the code that the agent needs.
