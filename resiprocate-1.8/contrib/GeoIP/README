				GeoIP 1.4.8
				-----------

*** Experimental IPv6 notice ***

- the experimental IPv6 part of libGeoIP may change in the future.
- It is possible, that geoiplookup and geoiplookup6 will merged.

***

The new perl script geoipupdate-pureperl.pl is a drop in replacement for
geoipupdate. Useful, if you like to customize, pre or postprocess new or
old databases. To archive the databases or signal apache whatever.
Another advantage is, that geoipupdate-pureperl.pl is able to handle proxy
requests even with authentication.

IMPORTANT API Change for 1.3.x and above users for GeoIP Region database
GeoIPRegion.region is no longer a pointer but an in-structure
array so test the first byte of region == 0 rather testing if the region
pointer is NULL.

IMPORTANT API Change for 1.1.x and above users - as of GeoIP 1.1.0 the
GeoIP_country_xxx_by_xxx functions return NULL if a country can not
be found (it used to return '--' or 'N/A'.  Be sure to check the
return value for NULL, to avoid segmentation faults!

GeoIP is a C library that enables the user to find geographical and
network information of an IP address.
Included is a free GeoLite Country database
that is updated at the beginning of every month.
To download the latest free GeoLite Country database, go to:
http://www.maxmind.com/app/geoip_country

There is also a free city-level geolocation database, GeoLite City,
available from:
http://www.maxmind.com/app/geolitecity

We also offer commercial GeoIP databases with greater accuracy and
additional network information, for more details, see:
http://www.maxmind.com/app/products

As of version 1.4.5 geoipupdate can handle updates via  HTTP Proxy Server.
If the environ variable http_proxy="http://proxy-host:port" is set.
The username:password (as in FTP URLs) is not supported! 
Thanks to Andrew Droffner for the patch!

As of version 1.3.6, the GeoIP C library is thread safe, as long as
GEOIP_CHECK_CACHE is not used.

This module can be used to automatically select the geographically closest
mirror, to analyze your web server logs to determine the countries of your
visitors, for credit card fraud detection, and for software export controls. 

If you use GeoIP to block access from high risk countries in order
to reduce fraud or abuse, you should also block access from known
proxy servers.  For more details, see:
http://www.maxmind.com/app/proxy

To install, run:

./configure
make
make check
make install

The GeoIP C library relies on GNU make, not on BSD make

MEMORY CACHING AND OTHER OPTIONS

There are four options available:

GEOIP_STANDARD - read database from filesystem, uses least memory.

GEOIP_MEMORY_CACHE - load database into memory, faster performance
	but uses more memory

GEOIP_CHECK_CACHE - check for updated database.  If database has been updated,
	reload filehandle and/or memory cache.

GEOIP_INDEX_CACHE - just cache
        the most frequently accessed index portion of the database, resulting
        in faster lookups than GEOIP_STANDARD, but less memory usage than
        GEOIP_MEMORY_CACHE - useful for larger databases such as
	GeoIP Organization and GeoIP City.  Note, for GeoIP Country, Region
	and Netspeed databases, GEOIP_INDEX_CACHE is equivalent to GEOIP_MEMORY_CACHE

GEOIP_MMAP_CACHE - load database into mmap shared memory ( MMAP is not avail for WIN32 )

The options can be combined using bit operators.  For example you can
use both GEOIP_MEMORY_CACHE and GEOIP_CHECK_CACHE by calling:

    GeoIP_open("/path/to/GeoIP.dat", GEOIP_MEMORY_CACHE | GEOIP_CHECK_CACHE);

By default, the city name is returned in iso-8859-1 charset.  To obtain the
city name in utf8 instead, run:

    GeoIP_set_charset(gi, GEOIP_CHARSET_UTF8);

To get the netmask of the netblock of the last lookup, use GeoIP_last_netblock(gi).

EXAMPLES

See
test/
     test-geoip.c
     test-geoip-region.c
     test-geoip-city.c
     test-geoip-isp.c
     test-geoip-org.c
     test-geoip-netspeed.c

for examples of how to use the API.  The test-geoip.c program works with both the GeoLite and
GeoIP Country databases.  The test-geoip-city.c program works with both the GeoLite and
GeoIP City databases.  The other example programs require the paid databases available
from http://www.maxmind.com/app/products

AUTOMATIC UPDATES

MaxMind offers a service where you can have your database updated
automically each week.  For more details see:

Preformance Patches.

Patrick McManus provide a patch to enhance the lookupspeed in MEMORY_CACHE mode. If you feel, that the current MEMORY_CACHE mode is to slow try the patch:

TROUBLESHOOTING

If you run into trouble building your application with GeoIP support, try adding -fms-extensions to your CFLAGS. If you use Solaris and there C-Compiler use -features=extensions instead. These options enable unnamed union support and fix problems like: 'improper member use: dma_code' or 'GeoIPRecord' has no member named 'dma_code'.

Note that it is recommended that you use GNU make.  Also, if you are using
OpenBSD, GeoIP requires OpenBSD 3.1 or greater.

if you get "cannot load shared object file: No such file or directory"
error, add the directory libGeoIP.so was installed to to /etc/ld.so.conf
and run ldconfig

On Solaris, if you get a
ld: fatal: relocations remain against allocatable but non-writable sections
error, try running

# make clean
# ./configure --disable-shared
# make

If you get a "ar : command not found" error, make sure that ar is
in your path.  On Solaris, ar is typically found in /usr/ccs/bin

If you get a "geoipupdate.c:24: getopt.h: No such file or directory"
error, run

# export CPPFLAGS="-I/usr/local/include"

(assuming that getopt.h is in /usr/local/include)

If you get a "zlib.h: No such file or directory" error, make sure
that the zlib development libraries are installed on your server.
These are typically included in a "zlib-devel" package.

If you get a "bad interpreter: No such file or directory" error
when running ./configure, make sure that there are no DOS
returns in the configure script.  To remove DOS returns,
run perl -pi -e 's!\r!!g' configure.

If gcc fails while consuming a large amount of memory, try
compiling with CFLAGS=-O1 (or -O0) instead of the default -O2.
It seems that some
versions of gcc have a bug and consume 1 GB of memory when optimizing
certain source files (the other source file where this was reported is
from XORG X-Server). It happens at least with gcc 3.3.1 and with gcc
4.2(.0).  Thanks to Kai Schätzl for the report.

If GEOIP_MMAP_CACHE doesn't work on a 64bit machine, try adding
the flag "MAP_32BIT" to the mmap call.

If you get a "passing argument 3 of 'gethostbyname_r' from incompatible pointer type"
error on AIX, download and/or untar a fresh copy of GeoIP.  ( To avoid cached
results from a previous ./configure run )

cd ./GeoIP-1.4.6
then edit the file ./configure

and delete these two lines:

#define HAVE_GETHOSTBYNAME_R 1

#define GETHOSTBYNAME_R_RETURNS_INT 1

then save the configure script

and build it as usual

./configure
make
sudo make install
