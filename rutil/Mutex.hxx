/**
   @brief A semaphore that can be locked by only one thread at a time.  

   Used to serialize access to some resource (such as a data member).  Here's
   an example:

   @code
     void
     Log::setLevel(Level level)
     {
        Lock lock(_mutex);
        _level = level; 
     }
   @endcode

   As indicated in the example, you will probably never use any member function 
   in this class.  The 'Lock' class provides this functionality.

   @see Lock
   @see Condition

// C++11 library
