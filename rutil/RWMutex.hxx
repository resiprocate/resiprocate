/**
   @brief Wraps the readers/writers mutex implementation on your platform.

   @note A readers/writers mutex is a mutex that can be locked in two differing
      ways:
         - A read-lock: Prevents other threads from obtaining a write-lock, but
            not other read-locks.
         - A write-lock: Prevents other threads from obtaining either a 
            read-lock or write-lock.

      Usually, if a thread attempts to aquire a write-lock while read-locks are
      being held, this will prevent any further read-locks from being obtained,
      until the write-lock is aquired and released. This prevents the "writer
      starvation" problem.
