  @brief 
  A <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Condition_variable#Condition_variables"> 
  condition variable</a> that can be signaled or waited on, wraps POSIX/Windows 
  implementations depending on environment.

   Here's an example (from ThreadIf):

@code
  void
  ThreadIf::shutdown()
  {
     Lock lock(mShutdownMutex);
     if (!mShutdown)
     {
        mShutdown = true;
        mShutdownCondition.notify_one();
     }
  }

  bool
  ThreadIf::waitForShutdown(int ms) const
  {
     Lock lock(mShutdownMutex);
     mShutdownCondition.wait(lock, ms);
     return mShutdown;
  }
  @endcode

  @see Mutex
*/

// We removed our local implementation and now we use the
// C++11 library
typedef std::condition_variable_any Condition;

}
