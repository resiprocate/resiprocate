/*
   Extending Repro by adding custom processors to the chain is as easy as overriding one of the 
   ReproRunner class virtual methods:
   virtual void addProcessor(repro::ProcessorChain& chain, std::unique_ptr<repro::Processor> processor);
   virtual void makeRequestProcessorChain(repro::ProcessorChain& chain);
   virtual void makeResponseProcessorChain(repro::ProcessorChain& chain);
   virtual void makeTargetProcessorChain(repro::ProcessorChain& chain);

   Override the makeXXXProcessorChain methods to add processors to the beginning or end of any chain,
   or override the addProcessor method, and you can examine the name of the processor being 
   added and add your own process either before or after the correct processor.  

   WARNING: Be careful when checking for names of optional processors.  Depending on
            the configuration some processors may not be enabled.

   Create an instance of your overridden ReproRunner class and call run to start everything 
   up.

   Example:

   class MyCustomProcessor : public Processor
   {
      public:
         MyCustomProcessor(ProxyConfig& config) : Processor("MyCustomProcessor") {}
         virtual ~MyCustomProcessor() {}
      
         virtual processor_action_t process(RequestContext &context)
         {  
            DebugLog(<< "Monkey handling request: " << *this << "; reqcontext = " << context);
            
            ...Do something interesting here....

            return Processor::Continue;
         }
      }
   };

   class MyReproRunner : public ReproRunner
   {
   public:
      MyReproRunner() {}
      virtual ~MyReproRunner() {}
   
   protected:
      virtual void addProcessor(repro::ProcessorChain& chain, std::unique_ptr<repro::Processor> processor)
      {
         if(processor->getName() == "LocationServer")
         {
            // Add MyCustomProcessor before LocationServer
            addProcessor(chain, std::unique_ptr<Processor>(new MyCustomProcessor(*mProxyConfig)));
         }
         ReproRunner::addProcessor(chain, processor);  // call base class implementation
      }
   };

   There is also generic storage available for custom Processor at three different
   scope levels via a KeyValueStore:
     -Global Proxy Scope - Proxy::getKeyValueStore
     -Request Scope - RequestContext::getKeyValueStore
     -Target Scope - Target::getKeyValueStore
   Before this storage can be used you must statically allocate a storage key.
   See mFromTrustedNodeKey use in the IsTrustedNode class for an example.
