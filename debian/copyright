Comment:
 All work was originally licensed under the 4-clause Vovida license.
 Upstream developers have been contributing new material to the
 project using a 3-clause BSD license.  Therefore, the overall
 project remains constrained by the 4th clause.  Each file has
 comments inside indicating whether it was contributed under
 the 4-clause or less restrictive 3-clause license.  When the
 product is used as a whole, the more restrictive 4-clause
 license is in effect.
 .
 This copyright file includes a copy of the Vovida license
 and also a copy of the BSD licenses used for newer parts of
 the code.
 .
 The project links against libradiusclient-ng2 which also has a
 BSD-derived 4-clause license.  The 4th clause of the Vovida
 and libradiusclient-ng2 licenses are compatible and cumulative
 when used together.
 .
 The project links against OpenSSL which has a 5-clause license.
 The OpenSSL license clauses are compatible and cumulative
 when used together.
