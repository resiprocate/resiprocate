/**
   @brief Class used to specify what sub-system given sections of code belong
      to, for use by the logging system.

   @note The logging macros defined in Logger.hxx assume that the preprocessor
      macro RESIPROCATE_SUBSYSTEM is defined to an instance of this class. The
      logging macro uses this object to determine what logging level should be
      used, and what sub-system the logging statement should come from. So, in
      your code you might do something like the following:

      @code
      #define RESIPROCATE_SUBSYSTEM Subsystem::APP
      //...
      void doStuff()
      {
         DebugLog(<< "Doing some stuff...");
      }
      @endcode

      This would cause your log statement to be marked as coming from 
      Subsystem::APP.
