Change the names of all the parser "components" to "integerparser" or
something like that

Complete the pre parser stuff so that transport can do framented messages

Change name of HeadersTy


need to add quote interface to DataParameter -- particularly, fetching
a parameter should return DataParameter& rather than Data .  the
application is responsible for passing in a quoted string if they want
quotes.

the application will never get back a quoted one when it asks for a
DataParameter.

there should be a UserData which is used for anything the user might
input.  it has the property that the stack will examine the contents
for quotable material, e.g. if you pass in

	Bob Smith

it will produce either

	Bob%20Smith

or

	"Bob Smith"

depending on what's right.


Missing classes of headers:

	Date
	Warning
	(someone should check these after done)

Make Symbols Data

Convert Data to unsigned char interface.

Add correct const semantics to parserCategories
explicity disallow paramaters or declare parameter accessors where they can be used
If we proper const parameter retrieval we should probably throw if the user tries to retrieve a parameter that doesn't exist.

make case sensitive/case insensitive datas

handle the case where a request gets sent over the wire to the stack with no via. currently will assert when getTransactionId() is called

- change StatusLine::responseCode() to StatusLine::statusCode()
- change CSeqCategory to CSeq

ParameterTypeEnums => ParametersEnum
ParameterTypes => Parameters

break up ParserCategories

Socket => FdSet, as FdSet is a class and socket isn't

Data::data() => Data::buffer()

Change BaseException::~BaseException to be pure virtual - cullen has changed this for a windows problem temporarily


TcpTransport has a long timeout in it if a tcp rst occurs
